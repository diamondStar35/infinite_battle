Fighter remake, quick setup instructions
There is a compiled version in the 'compiled' folder. However, if you want to run the game from source, you must install python, and go into your command prompt. cd to this directory and type
pip install -r requirements.txt
then you can run the game by typing
python fighter.py
You can open any of the .py files to modify them.
You can run build.bat to compile the game to an executable.
Maybe you can turn this into something more fun.
I think most of the keybinds are in 'ideas.txt', so look for them in that file.
Enjoy!
